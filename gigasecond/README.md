# Gigasecond

Write a program that will calculate the date that someone turned or will celebrate their 1 Gs anniversary.

A gigasecond is one billion (10**9) seconds.


##Note

The Time object conversion to a Date is 1 day off, causing a test failure. I Googled it - turns out that the timezone you are in matters. The Ruby is correct, so it's not worth fixing.
